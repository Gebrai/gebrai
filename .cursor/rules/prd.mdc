# Product Requirements Document: GeoGebra MCP Tool

## **Product Overview**

The GeoGebra MCP Tool is a Model Context Protocol server that enables AI models to interact with GeoGebra's mathematical software suite. This tool allows AI assistants to create, manipulate, and analyze mathematical constructions, graphs, and geometric objects through GeoGebra's comprehensive API, bringing dynamic mathematical visualization capabilities directly into AI conversations[1][2].

## **Problem Statement**

Current AI models excel at mathematical reasoning and problem-solving but lack the ability to create interactive mathematical visualizations and dynamic constructions. Students, educators, and researchers need AI assistants that can not only solve mathematical problems but also generate visual representations, interactive graphs, and geometric constructions that enhance understanding and exploration of mathematical concepts.

## **Target Users**

**Primary Users:**
- **Mathematics Educators**: Teachers who want AI assistance in creating interactive lessons and visual demonstrations
- **Students**: Learners who need AI help with mathematical problem-solving that includes visual components
- **Researchers**: Academics requiring dynamic mathematical modeling and visualization

**Secondary Users:**
- **Educational Content Creators**: Developers building AI-powered educational platforms
- **Tutoring Applications**: AI tutoring systems that need mathematical visualization capabilities

## **Product Goals**

### **Primary Objectives**
- Enable AI models to create and manipulate GeoGebra constructions programmatically
- Provide seamless integration between natural language mathematical requests and visual outputs
- Support real-time mathematical exploration and hypothesis testing through AI

### **Success Metrics**
- **Adoption Rate**: 1,000+ active MCP server instances within 6 months
- **User Engagement**: Average of 50+ tool calls per active user per month
- **Educational Impact**: 80% of educator users report improved student engagement
- **Technical Performance**: <2 second response time for construction creation

## **Core Features**

### **Mathematical Construction Tools**
The MCP server will expose GeoGebra's construction capabilities through standardized tools:

- **Create Geometric Objects**: Points, lines, circles, polygons, and conic sections
- **Function Plotting**: Graph mathematical functions with customizable parameters
- **Dynamic Manipulations**: Modify existing constructions with real-time updates
- **Measurement Tools**: Calculate distances, areas, angles, and other geometric properties

### **Visualization Management**
- **Export Capabilities**: Generate PNG, SVG, and PDF outputs of constructions[2]
- **View Configuration**: Control graphics view settings, zoom levels, and coordinate systems
- **Style Customization**: Modify colors, line styles, point styles, and labels[2]
- **Animation Controls**: Create and manage animated mathematical demonstrations

### **Algebraic Integration**
- **CAS Operations**: Leverage GeoGebra's Computer Algebra System for symbolic computation[6]
- **Equation Solving**: Solve systems of equations with visual representation
- **Calculus Tools**: Perform differentiation and integration with graphical output[6]
- **Statistical Analysis**: Create statistical plots and perform data analysis

## **Technical Architecture**

### **MCP Server Implementation**
Following the standard MCP protocol structure, the server will implement:

**Tool Discovery**: Expose available GeoGebra functions through the `tools/list` method[7]
**Tool Execution**: Handle `tools/call` requests to execute GeoGebra commands[7]
**Error Handling**: Provide structured error responses for invalid operations
**State Management**: Maintain construction state across multiple tool calls

### **GeoGebra Integration**
The server will utilize GeoGebra's Apps API to:

- **Command Evaluation**: Execute GeoGebra commands using `evalCommand()` method[2]
- **Object Manipulation**: Create, modify, and delete mathematical objects
- **Export Functions**: Generate visual outputs using `getPNGBase64()` and `exportSVG()`[2]
- **State Queries**: Retrieve object properties and construction information

### **Security and Performance**
- **Local Execution**: Run GeoGebra instances locally for data privacy[5]
- **Resource Management**: Implement connection pooling and cleanup procedures
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize mathematical expressions and commands
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent resource exhaustion from excessive requests

## **User Experience Design**

### **AI Interaction Patterns**

**Natural Language Processing**: AI models can interpret requests like "Create a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (3,4), and (5,0), then find its area"

**Progressive Construction**: Support multi-step mathematical explorations where each AI response builds upon previous constructions

**Educational Scaffolding**: Enable AI to create step-by-step mathematical demonstrations with visual progression

### **Output Formats**

**Interactive Constructions**: Generate GeoGebra applet code for embedding in educational platforms
**Static Visualizations**: Provide high-quality image exports for documentation and presentations
**Mathematical Reports**: Combine visual constructions with calculated results and explanations
