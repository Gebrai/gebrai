# Product Requirements Document: Barcode Alarm Clock App

## **Core Idea and Purpose**

The Barcode Alarm Clock is a mobile application designed to solve the common problem of oversleeping by requiring users to physically get up and scan a product barcode to turn off the alarm[6][17]. Unlike traditional alarm clocks that can be easily snoozed or dismissed, this app forces users out of bed by making them interact with a physical object, such as a toothpaste tube in their bathroom, ensuring they are fully awake and mobile[19].

**Primary Objectives:**
- Help heavy sleepers and chronic oversleepers establish better morning routines
- Eliminate the possibility of turning off alarms while still in bed
- Create a reliable wake-up system that prevents tardiness to important commitments
- Provide an interactive alarm experience that ensures users are alert when the alarm stops

## **Target Audience and Market Analysis**

**Primary Users:**
- Heavy sleepers who struggle with traditional alarm clocks
- Students and professionals who frequently oversleep
- People with important morning commitments (meetings, classes, work)
- Individuals looking to establish healthier morning routines[6]

**User Personas:**
- **College Student Sam**: Ages 18-24, lives in dorm/apartment, frequently misses morning classes due to oversleeping
- **Professional Pat**: Ages 25-40, remote worker or office employee, needs reliable wake-up for important morning meetings
- **Health-Conscious Helen**: Ages 30-50, wants to establish consistent morning routine for exercise or self-care

## **Technical Specifications**

**Platform and Framework:**
- Built using Expo framework for React Native development[3][4]
- Target platforms: iOS and Android
- Minimum iOS version: 13.0
- Minimum Android API level: 21

**Barcode Scanning Technology:**
- Implementation using `expo-camera` library (expo-barcode-scanner is deprecated as of SDK 51)[11][18]
- Support for multiple barcode formats: QR codes, EAN, UPC, Code 39, Code 128, and others[12][13]
- Real-time camera preview with barcode detection capabilities[18]

**Required Permissions:**
- Camera access for barcode scanning[13]
- Microphone access for alarm functionality
- Storage access for custom alarm sounds
- Notification permissions for alarm alerts

## **Functional Requirements**

### **Core Alarm Features**
- **Multiple Alarm Management**: Users can set multiple recurring or one-time alarms
- **Barcode Registration**: Allow users to scan and register specific product barcodes that will turn off each alarm[6][19]
- **Alarm Lock Feature**: Prevent users from disabling alarms once set, with no mute or snooze options[17][19]
- **Loud Ringtones**: Provide procedurally generated, unpredictable alarm sounds to prevent auditory adaptation[6][17]
- **Custom Sound Options**: Support for user's music library integration and ringtone playlists[6]

### **Barcode Scanning Features**
- **Quick Scan Interface**: Implement efficient barcode scanning using expo-camera's built-in capabilities[18]
- **Multiple Barcode Support**: Allow different products to be registered for different alarms[6][19]
- **Scan Validation**: Verify scanned barcode matches the registered barcode before turning off alarm
- **Backup Options**: Provide alternative methods if primary barcode becomes unavailable

### **User Experience Features**
- **Bedside Clock**: Full-screen customizable clock display with multiple themes[6][19]
- **Morning Routine Tracker**: Help users establish and track morning habits[6]
- **Bedtime Reminders**: Optional features to encourage healthy sleep schedules[6]
- **Dark Mode**: Support for dark theme to reduce eye strain[6][19]

## **Non-Functional Requirements**

### **Performance Requirements**
- **Barcode Scanning Speed**: Achieve scan recognition within 1-2 seconds under normal lighting conditions[3][7]
- **App Launch Time**: Application must launch within 3 seconds to ensure alarm reliability
- **Battery Optimization**: Implement efficient battery usage, especially during overnight alarm setting
- **Offline Functionality**: Core alarm and scanning features must work without internet connection

### **Security and Privacy**
- **Data Protection**: Store user alarm preferences and registered barcodes locally on device
- **Camera Privacy**: Only access camera when actively scanning, with clear user permissions[8]
- **No Data Collection**: Minimal data collection approach, focusing on device-local functionality

### **Usability Requirements**
- **Accessibility**: Support for screen readers and large text options
- **Intuitive Interface**: Simple setup process for non-technical users
- **Error Handling**: Clear feedback when barcodes cannot be scanned or recognized[7]
- **Multi-language Support**: Initial support for English, with framework for additional languages

## **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Barcode Scanning Implementation**
```
- Use expo-camera with barcodeScannerEnabled prop
- Implement CameraView component with onBarcodeScanned callback
- Support frame processor for real-time scanning feedback
- Include camera permission handling and error states
```

### **Data Storage**
- Local SQLite database for alarm configurations and registered barcodes
- Async Storage for user preferences and settings
- Secure storage for sensitive alarm lock configurations

### **Audio System**
- Integration with device's native audio system for alarm sounds
- Support for both built-in and custom audio files
- Volume enforcement to prevent muting[6][17]

## **Project Timeline and Milestones**

### **Phase 1: Core Development (8 weeks)**
- **Weeks 1-2**: Project setup, Expo configuration, basic UI framework
- **Weeks 3-4**: Implement core alarm functionality and sound system
- **Weeks 5-6**: Integrate barcode scanning using expo-camera
- **Weeks 7-8**: Connect alarm dismissal with barcode validation

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Features (6 weeks)**
- **Weeks 9-10**: Implement multiple alarm management and barcode registration
- **Weeks 11-12**: Add bedside clock and customization features
- **Weeks 13-14**: Integrate morning routine tracking and bedtime features

### **Phase 3: Testing and Polish (4 weeks)**
- **Weeks 15-16**: Comprehensive testing on various devices and lighting conditions
- **Weeks 17-18**: UI/UX refinements, performance optimization, and app store preparation

## **Success Metrics and Release Criteria**

### **Technical Metrics**
- Barcode scanning success rate: >95% under normal lighting conditions
- App crash rate: 80% of downloads complete initial alarm setup
- Feature adoption: >60% of users register multiple barcodes within first week
- User retention: >40% active usage after 30 days

### **Release Criteria**
- All core functionality (alarm setting, barcode scanning, alarm dismissal) working reliably
- Successful testing on minimum 10 different device models
- App store compliance for both iOS and Android platforms
- Performance benchmarks met for scanning speed and battery usage

## **Communication and Development Approach**

### **Stakeholder Roles**
- **Product Owner**: Final approval on feature specifications and user experience decisions
- **Development Team**: Responsible for technical implementation and testing
- **UX/UI Designer**: Interface design and user flow optimization
- **QA Tester**: Device testing and edge case validation

### **Communication Schedule**
- Weekly progress reviews every Monday
- Bi-weekly stakeholder demos starting in Week 3
- Daily standups for development team during active development phases
- Final review and approval sessions before each phase completion

The success of this barcode alarm clock app relies heavily on the reliability of both the alarm system and barcode scanning functionality, as users depend on it for critical wake-up needs[6][17]. The technical implementation using Expo provides a solid foundation for cross-platform development while leveraging native camera capabilities for efficient barcode scanning[3][18].
