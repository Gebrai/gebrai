## ðŸŽ¯ Linear Method Principles Applied

### âœ… **Build for the creators**
- Focused on AI developers, educators, and students as primary users
- Prioritized tools that enhance productivity for mathematical content creation

### âœ… **Purpose-built**
- Specific tools for mathematical visualization, not generic solutions
- Each MCP tool serves a clear mathematical purpose

### âœ… **Create momentum â€“ don't sprint**
- Organized into 2-week cycles with sustainable pace
- Clear deliverables for each cycle to maintain healthy momentum

### âœ… **Meaningful direction**
- All issues connect to the larger goal of AI-mathematical visualization
- Each phase builds logically toward the complete solution

### âœ… **Aim for clarity**
- Used standard terminology (projects, issues, cycles)
- Clear, descriptive issue titles and acceptance criteria

### âœ… **Say no to busy work**
- Focused on essential features that directly serve user needs
- Automated testing and CI/CD to reduce manual overhead

### âœ… **Simple first, then powerful**
- Started with basic geometric constructions
- Advanced features (CAS, animations) planned for later phases

### âœ… **Decide and move on**
- Clear priorities set for each issue
- Specific acceptance criteria to avoid endless iteration

## ðŸ”„ Linear Method Practices Implemented

### âœ… **Set strategic product initiatives**
- Created ambitious goal of bridging AI reasoning with mathematical visualization
- Reserved capacity for unplanned work in cycle planning

### âœ… **Connect daily work to larger goals with projects**
- All issues linked to the main GeoGebra MCP Tool project
- Each issue description includes phase and strategic context

### âœ… **Work in 2-week cycles**
- Planned initial cycles with reasonable scope
- Issues sized for completion within cycle timeframes

### âœ… **Keep a manageable backlog**
- Focused backlog on essential features
- Issues organized by priority and phase

### âœ… **Mix feature and quality work**
- Testing suite (GEB-11) runs parallel to feature development
- Performance optimization (GEB-9) included as high priority

### âœ… **Specify project and issue owners**
- All issues assigned to project owner (efebaus)
- Clear responsibility for delivery

### âœ… **Write project specs**
- Comprehensive project description with goals, metrics, and scope
- Each issue includes objective, acceptance criteria, and definition of done

### âœ… **Scope issues to be as small as possible**
- Issues sized for 3-10 days of work
- Concrete, achievable deliverables for each issue

### âœ… **Measure progress with actual work**
- Clear acceptance criteria for each issue
- Emphasis on working code and tests as progress indicators

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### **Immediate Actions (Cycle 1)**
1. **Start GEB-1**: Initialize MCP server framework
2. **Begin GEB-2**: Set up GeoGebra API integration  
3. **Establish GEB-11**: Create testing foundation

### **Cycle Management**
- Weekly progress reviews every Monday
- Bi-weekly stakeholder demos starting Week 3
- Adjust cycle planning based on actual velocity
- Move incomplete items to next cycle automatically

### **Success Tracking**
- Monitor response time performance from early development
- Track tool usage patterns once deployed
- Gather educator feedback for educational features

## ðŸ“Š Project Health Indicators

**Current Status**: âœ… Ready to Start  
**Issues Created**: 11  
**Phases Planned**: 4  
**Timeline**: 8 months  
**Method Compliance**: 100%

The project is now properly structured following Linear's Method and ready for development to begin with Cycle 1.
